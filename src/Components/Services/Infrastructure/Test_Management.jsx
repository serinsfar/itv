<p className='p-5'>Many companies are aware of the dependency of software and focus actively on an enhanced quality of their 
    software systems and their process of developing software. Frictionless operations and processes in companies or organisations 
    are depending extensively on the reliability of their software systems. The quality of software in technical and commercial systems 
    is one of the essential key performance indicators (KPI) for successful products or enterprises. One way to reach high quality is to 
    systematically test and audit the developed software. The expected benefit will be reached when the software is tested against your requirements.</p>
